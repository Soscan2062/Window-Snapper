# WindowSnapper
AHK script to more easily resize windows.

Instructions:
1. Position your windows roughly where you want them. Maximize as necessary.
2. Run the script and resize windows normally.
   Your window edge will snap to the nearest one.
   If it's maxamized it won't pass that window.

Known limitations:
* If there are windows behind what you want to adjust they can be influenced as well.
* Once two un-maximized are moving together they will stop if you move too quickly.

Possible future features (in order of most to least likely):
* Better way to keep two windows together while moving edges.
* Better snapping.
